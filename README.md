<img src="readme_left.png" width=170px /> 

I'm an undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, with a keen interest in autonomous robotics and software development.

I've always loved maths and love solving algorithmic problems and optimizing software to run them on my _minimal_ system. Currently interested in decentralised technologies and a novice supporter of the dWeb.
